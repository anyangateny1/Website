## Personal Website

This repo contains the source code for my personal site (`atenyanyang.com`):

- **Frontend**: Single-page React app (Chakra UI, React Router) in `frontend/`
- **Backend**: Java serverless API (AWS Lambda via Maven) in `backend/`

Used primarily to play around with AWS and a web dev stack.

It’s here mostly as a portfolio/reference, I’m not really expecting other people to clone and run it.
